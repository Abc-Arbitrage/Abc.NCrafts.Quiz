Tail recursion.  In the slower answer the last statement of the Factorial function is a multiplication whereas in the faster answer it is a recursive call.
The JIT will be able to optimise tail recursive functions into simple loops instead of recursive calls.  This has the added benefit of not being prone to stack overflows.
