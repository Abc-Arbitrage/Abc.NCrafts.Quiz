`GetHashCode` is a method defined on `System.Object`. The default implementation of this method calls `RuntimeHelpers.GetHashCode` which is implemented externally in native code and allocates intermediary objects on the heap. By providing an explicit override of the method in the struct definition, we can prevent these allocations. Note that in all answers, no boxing occurs since the compiler is able in this context to emit *constrained virtual calls*.
